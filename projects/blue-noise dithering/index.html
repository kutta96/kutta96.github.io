            </header>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Compared to white noise, blue noise has less low-frequency energy in Fourier power spectrum. After using simulated annealing<sup>[1]</sup>, the blue-noise pattern 
    could be seen obviously although both have the same MSE. In Iliyan’s words<sup>[1]</sup>, the white noise is the random decorrelation while the blue noise is 
    the intentional correlation.
</p>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<p><b>Direct Offset in Sample Space</b><sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p>After creating normal sampling pattern, for each pixel, the value from dither mask is used to offset the sample pattern.</p>

<p><b>Seed Permutation in Sample Space</b><sup>[2]</sup></p>

<p>Each pixel is rendered by a random sequence represented by a certain seed. The seed permutation in local small blocks improves the visual fidelity, 
    and accumulates improvements across frames. 
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Important parameters can be easily controlled and analyzed in my soft path tracer. The basic sampler is a Sobol sampler and the mask size is the same as the image size.
    Because of the light sampling and indirect illumination (one bounce), the integral dimension is 6. The sample count is 4spp.

<p>Although improvements still exist, the theory of blue-noise dithered sampling<sup>[1]</sup> makes it difficult when dealing with complicated scenes.The second 
    algorithm shows obvious improvements due to the locality assumption and operation within a small neighborhood. The block size is 4×4 and the sorting pass is used only. 
    The sample count is 4spp, and the maximum depth is 5.

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<h3>Insights into High-dimension Integrals</h3>

<p>For the first algorithm, the problem that blue-noise pattern vanishes rapidly in high-dimensional scenes can be physically explained in the figure.
     A small neighborhood where two rays firstly hit the diffused object surface. For traditional white-noise patterns, randomly generated 
     secondary rays may hit similar regions again (green wall), and then the cluster or unpleasing block appears.
     <br>In contrast, the blue-noise pattern makes secondary rays travel in two different directions. However, for two secondary rays, it seems 
     meaningless to avoid traveling in different directions. Therefore, the reason why blue-noise dithered sampling could improve the image is that 
     the first few dimensions avoid the similarity of light transport equations in sample space for local pixels. The first few dimensions (<=3 dimensions) 
     is enough.

<p>The comparison of Fourier power spectrum shows that the first bounce largely determines the quality.</p>

<h3>Insights into Large Sample Counts</h3>

<p>Sobol sequences tend to uniformly cover the sample space. If the offset is constant for each subpixel, the blue-noise property vanishes rapidly with the sample count, 
    leading to a white-noise Fourier spec (Fig. 1). If we use the golden ratio<sup>[3]</sup>, a weak blue-noise Fourier spec. could appear (Fig. 2).
</p>

<h3>Adaptive Strategy for the Block Size</h3>

<p>An appropriate block size is important for some applications where few frames could be obtained. Based on the assumption that pixels and their integrands are similar 
    within the boundary, I develop a primary adaptive strategy. First, Sobel edge detector is used and converts images to binary textures where edges are 1 and the left are 0. 
    Second, divide the image using the maximum block size such as 8×8 when there are no edges. Otherwise, the block size should be divided into 4×4 until the size reaches 
    the minimum size such as 2×2.
    <br>Improvements can be seen. In regions with simple integrands, some "holes" are filled and surfaces look more smooth. In contrast, the ceiling does not 
    change due to high-dimensional integrals. However, limited changes could be predicted when rendering scenes with complicated integrands and specular materials.
